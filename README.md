# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MSEXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
In this project, we have analyzed a bank's credit card data using Excel. After cleaning and enhancing the data with functions like VLOOKUP and IF, we created KPIs, pivot tables, and pivot charts based on factors like age, gender, and income. We built a dashboard with slicers to visualize spending patterns and customer behavior.
This project not only improved our Excel skills but also gave us hands-on experience in financial data analysis. We learned how to interpret trends, identify key metrics, and present insights in a clear and interactive way. It helped us understand the importance of data visualization in real-world decision-making.
