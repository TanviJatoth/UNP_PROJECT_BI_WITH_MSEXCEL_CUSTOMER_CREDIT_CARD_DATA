# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MSEXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
We analyzed a bank's credit card data using Excel. After cleaning and enhancing the data with functions like VLOOKUP and IF, we created KPIs, pivot tables, and pivot charts based on factors like age, gender, and income. We built a dashboard with slicers to visualize spending patterns and customer behavior.
